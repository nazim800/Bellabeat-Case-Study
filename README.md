## Introduction
In this case study, I analyze historical smart device usage data from Bellabeat, a high-tech wellness company specializing in health-focused products for women. The goal is to identify key trends in consumer behavior and provide data-driven recommendations to optimize Bellabeatâ€™s marketing strategy.
To answer the key business questions, I will follow the Google Data Analytics process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.

The main tools I used are Microsoft Excel for merging table at ease, SQL for data processing and Power BI for data visualization.
